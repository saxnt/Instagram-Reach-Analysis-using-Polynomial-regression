# Instagram Reach Analysis 🔎📲

This is your one-stop fun-filled project to analyze Instagram reach metrics! We're diving into the world of likes, hashtags, and "follows" like true social media detectives! 🕵️‍♂️

### 1. The Notebook: `Polynomial_Linear_Regression.ipynb` 📓
Here's where the magic happens:

#### a. **Data Loading and Inspection** 🕵️
- Our data includes juicy metrics like impressions, likes, shares, and more. 🍇
- Target: "Follows." The Holy Grail of social media success! 🌟

#### b. **Data Preprocessing** 🔧
- We scrub the data cleaner than your bathroom tiles. Say goodbye to NaNs! 🛏️

#### c. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🎨
- Heatmaps hotter than trending hashtags. 🔥
- Scatterplots that reveal the secrets of viral content. 🔍

#### d. **Model Training** 🚀
- Polynomial regression so smart it might just DM you back. 🕺
- Splitting data like we're divvying up pizza (training vs. testing). 🍕

#### e. **Model Evaluation** 🔢
- The moment of truth: does the model predict success, or does it ghost us? 🙈
